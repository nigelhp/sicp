## Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)

This fork contains the examples and exercises that I have experimented with
while working through Abelson & Sussman's classic text.  While the book uses
Scheme, I have chosen to work through as much as possible in Clojure. 


## sicp-mailonline

I have been working through the book as a member of the Mailonline SICP Study
Group, which can be found at: 
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sicp-mailonline.

Each member of the group commits their exercise solutions to their own branch of
the origin repository.  This fork is simply a merge of my branch to master.
Please refer to the many alternative branches in the origin repository to
investigate the approaches taken by other members of the group.

If you would like to experiment with SICP yourself, please consider joining the
study group, and adding your own branch to the origin repository.
