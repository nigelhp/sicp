## Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)

This repository contains the examples and exercises that I have experimented with
while working through Abelson & Sussman's classic text.  While the book uses
Scheme, I have chosen to work through as much as possible in Clojure. 


## sicp-mailonline

I have been working through the book as a member of the Mailonline SICP Study
Group, which can be found at: 
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sicp-mailonline.

Each member of the group commits their exercise solutions to their own branch of
the repository located at: https://github.com/MailOnline/sicp-mailonline.  This
repository is simply a copy of my branch.  Please refer to the original
sicp-mailonline repository, and the many branches contained therein, to
investigate the different approaches taken to the SICP exercises by other
members of the group.

If you would like to experiment with SICP yourself, please consider joining the
study group.
